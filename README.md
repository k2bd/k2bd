## My Stack

[![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=k2bd&hide=html,css,javascript,dockerfile,shell&layout=compact&theme=cobalt2)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I primarily use Python for backend, scientific, and general-purpose work, and use React/Typescript for building web apps.

For deployment, I am happy with both GCP and AWS. For hosting, I use GitHub Pages for open source projects.

I also really like Rust and use it for a lot of little side-projects.

## I'm Currently Working On

### ``flux`` database migration tool

Status: Not yet useful; early development

I'm currently working on a database migration tool whose primary aim is to provide the power of modular code with Python-based migration files and useful Python-based testing tools, while also providing strong robustness checks like migration directory corruption detection.

It also has some cool design features such as a plugin-based database backend design, meaning that anyone can easily extend the tool to work with their particular DBMS and use-case without the library needing to maintain support for each one separately.
It does maintain a Postgres backend internally that can be optionally installed.

## Libraries I Maintain

### Firebasil

Status: Useful; partially complete

This is a project aiming to bring a good client library for some of Firebase's tools to Python. At the moment it's mainly useful as:
- an auth client, including for quickly generating users and tokens for testing backend applications that might use ``firebase-admin``
- a realtime database client

### DBMS Development

I'm currently going through the [CMU Intro to Database Systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjbohkNBWQs_otTrBTrjyohi) course, learning more about database systems and following the coursework in Rust. Following this I will be going through the advanced course as well as starting fresh on the long path of building out a system designed for production use.

You can follow my work on the coursework here:
